For first-time users of the MXChip IoT DevKit (a.k.a. DevKit), follow these quick steps to:
- Prepare your development environment.
- Send temperature and humidity data from built-in DevKit sensors to the Azure IoT Hub.

If you have already done this, you can try more samples from the [Projects Catalog]({{"/docs/projects/" | absolute_url }}) or build your own IoT application.

## Configure Wi-Fi

IoT projects rely on internet connectivity. Use AP Mode on the DevKit to configure and connect to Wi-Fi.

1. Hold down button B, push and release the reset button, and then release button B. Your DevKit enters AP mode for configuring the Wi-Fi connection. The screen displays the service set identifier (SSID) of the DevKit and the configuration portal IP address:
  ![Reset button, button B, and SSID]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/wifi-ap.jpg" | absolute_url }})

2. Use a Web browser on a different Wi-Fi enabled device (computer or mobile phone) to connect to the DevKit SSID displayed in the previous step. If it asks for a password, leave it empty.
  ![Network info and Connect button]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/connect-ssid.png" | absolute_url }})

3. Open **192.168.0.1** in the browser. Select the Wi-Fi network that you want the DevKit to connect to, type the password for the Wi-Fi conection, and then click **Connect**.
  ![Password box and Connect button]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/wifi-portal.png" | absolute_url }})

4. The DevKit reboots in a few seconds. You then see the Wi-Fi name and assigned IP address on the screen of the DevKit:
  ![Wi-Fi name and IP address]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/wifi-ip.jpg" | absolute_url }})

**Note:** After  asuccessful Wi-Fi connection, the currently-installed and latest available version of the DevKit's firmware is displayed on the DevKit screen. If the DevKit is not running on the latest available version, follow the [firmware upgrading guide]({{"/docs/firmware-upgrading/" | absolute_url }}) to install the latest version.

## Install development environment

We recommend [Azure IoT Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-iot-workbench) extension for Visual Studio Code to develop on the IoT DevKit.

Azure IoT Workbench provides an integrated experience to develop IoT solutions. It helps both on device and cloud development using Azure IoT and other services. You can watch this [Channel9 video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/IoT-Workbench-extension-for-VS-Code) to have an overview of what it does.

Follow these steps to prepare the development environment for IoT DevKit:
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](), a cross platform source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

We encourage you to use the following one-click installation process to prepare the development environment. If you encounter any problems, you can always follow the [manual steps]({{"/docs/installation/" | absolute_url }}) to complete the process.
